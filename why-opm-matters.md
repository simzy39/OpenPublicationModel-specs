# Why OPM Matters
## Institutional and Industry Value Brief

**Status:** Non-Normative  
**Authority:** None  
**Purpose:** Explain institutional, platform, and ecosystem value  
**Audience:** Libraries, publishers, platform operators, vendors, standards bodies, accessibility and compliance stakeholders  
**Author:** Heath Luke Sims  

This document introduces no requirements.  
All normative authority resides exclusively in the OPM Architectural Foundations and OPM Technical Specifications.

This document exists to explain **why** the Open Publication Model (OPM) matters to real organisations — not how it works.

---

## Important Note on Scope

This document is **optional** and does **not** define or interpret the architecture.

It exists to translate **architectural guarantees** into **institutional impact**.

---

## 1. The Problem OPM Addresses (Plainly)

The publishing ecosystem relies today on assumptions that cannot be verified:

- semantic meaning is often inferred, not declared
- accessibility claims are derived from heuristics
- compatibility is judged by runtime success
- preservation captures files or behavior, not truth
- “it works” is treated as evidence of support

These are not tooling issues.  
They are **architectural gaps**.

OPM exists to close those gaps by defining **where authority lives** and **how truth is computed**.

---

## 2. What OPM Changes (At a Structural Level)

OPM introduces three foundational shifts:

### Meaning is explicit or absent

If something matters, it must be declared.  
If it is not declared, it is not assumed.

### Compatibility is computable

Support is a determinable fact, not an observation.

### Truth is time-stable

Evaluation results remain auditable years later, in their original context.

These are not features.  
They are **architectural guarantees**.

Everything OPM enables follows from them.

## 3. Why This Matters to Libraries and Archives

Libraries are custodial institutions, not runtime environments.

OPM enables libraries to:

- preserve semantic meaning, not frozen behavior
- record what was known at the time of acquisition
- distinguish absence, incompatibility, and uncertainty
- support accessibility accountability without inference
- separate access policy from factual truth

In practical terms:

> **OPM allows libraries to preserve facts rather than guesses.**

This directly supports:

- legal deposit obligations
- national and research library mandates
- long-term accessibility accountability
- defensible preservation strategies

---

## 4. Why This Matters to Platforms and Reading Systems

Platforms today absorb hidden costs caused by ambiguity:

- unclear support claims
- inconsistent accessibility behavior
- disputes based on “it worked for me”
- compliance and reputational risk

OPM enables platforms to:

- compute support deterministically
- make precise, defensible claims
- separate rendering from support
- reduce ambiguity in bug reports and contracts
- negotiate capabilities explicitly

In practical terms:

> **OPM turns “support” from a vague promise into a computable contract.**

This lowers:

- support burden
- operational ambiguity
- compliance exposure
- long-term maintenance risk

---

## 5. Why This Matters to Publishers and Content Owners

Publishers are increasingly asked to assert things they cannot reliably verify:

- accessibility conformance
- platform compatibility
- preservation fidelity

OPM enables publishers to:

- declare intent explicitly
- disclose semantic loss honestly
- avoid implied or accidental claims
- align accessibility statements with architecture
- ship content with known truth states

In practical terms:

> **OPM lets publishers know what they are actually shipping — and what they are not.**

This matters for:

- institutional markets
- education and public-sector procurement
- accessibility statements
- long-term trust

---

## 6. Why This Matters for Compliance and Risk

Regulatory and legal risk increasingly depends on **what was known, when**.

OPM enables organisations to:

- record evaluation context explicitly
- preserve time-bound truth
- demonstrate good-faith evaluation
- avoid retroactive reinterpretation
- distinguish unknown from unsupported

In practical terms:

> **OPM reduces risk by making truth auditable instead of assumed.**

This is operational risk reduction, not theory.

---

## 7. Why OPM Enables More Than EPUB

EPUB tolerates ambiguity by design.  
OPM does not.

As a result, OPM enables:

- structural accessibility instead of inferred accessibility
- deterministic compatibility evaluation
- honest degradation instead of silent failure
- long-term semantic interoperability
- ecosystem growth without authority drift

OPM does not replace EPUB as a container.  
It replaces EPUB’s **lack of architectural authority**.

---

## 8. What OPM Does Not Do

OPM does **not**:

- mandate UX or business models
- enforce access decisions
- replace existing formats or workflows
- require central governance or control

It provides a **truthful substrate** on which those things can operate honestly.

---

## Final Statement

OPM is not about stricter publishing.

It is about removing ambiguity where ambiguity causes harm.

By making meaning explicit, compatibility computable, and truth preservable,  
OPM enables libraries, platforms, and publishers to scale — **without pretending certainty where none exists**.

## How to Use This Document (Important)

- This document is **optional**
- It is **not** a prerequisite for reading the specifications
- It is intended for:
  - industry discussion
  - standards evaluation
  - institutional decision-making

The specifications define the architecture.  
This document explains **why that architecture matters**.
