# Contributing to the Open Publication Model (OPM)

Thank you for your interest in the Open Publication Model.

This repository contains the architectural foundations and specification corpus for OPM.  
Contributions, feedback, and discussion are welcome, but the project follows a **single-maintainer / benevolent-dictator model** to preserve architectural coherence.

---

## Contribution Model

OPM is developed under a **central editorial authority**.

This means:

- Architectural direction is set by the project maintainer.
- Final decisions on specification content rest with the maintainer.
- Consensus is not required for changes to be accepted or rejected.
- Architectural coherence and long-term correctness take priority over popularity.

This model is intentional and designed to prevent fragmentation, ambiguity, and premature compromise.

---

## What Contributions Are Welcome

The following forms of contribution are encouraged:

- Issue reports identifying ambiguities, inconsistencies, or errors
- Requests for clarification or additional explanatory material
- Concrete examples or edge cases that stress the architecture
- Editorial corrections (typos, clarity, structure)
- Implementation feedback based on real systems or workflows

All contributions should focus on **improving clarity, correctness, or usefulness**, not expanding scope by default.

---

## What Contributions Are Not Guaranteed

Submitting a contribution does **not** guarantee that it will be:

- accepted
- merged
- implemented as proposed
- implemented at all

Rejection of a contribution does not imply disagreement with the problem being raised.  
It may reflect architectural constraints, scope decisions, or long-term design goals.

## How to Contribute

1. **Open an issue first** for any substantive change or proposal.
2. Clearly describe:
   - the problem being addressed
   - why it matters
   - how it interacts with existing specifications
3. Avoid proposing
