# OPM Architectural Foundations

This directory contains the **Architectural Foundations** of the Open Publication Model (OPM).

The Architectural Foundations define:
- architectural boundaries and invariants
- authority flow and interpretation constraints
- rules governing meaning, compatibility, and truth
- limits on what technical specifications may define

All OPM technical specifications are **subordinate** to these documents.  
No specification may contradict or override the Architectural Foundations.

The documents in this directory are **normative** unless explicitly stated otherwise.
