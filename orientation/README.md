# OPM Orientation Documents (Non-Normative)

This directory contains **non-normative orientation documents** for the Open Publication Model (OPM).

These documents introduce **no requirements** and carry **no normative authority**.  
Their purpose is to establish the architectural boundaries, mental models, and expectations required to read the OPM specifications correctly.

OPM is not designed to be discovered by reading isolated specifications.  
It is designed to be understood as a system.

## Required Orientation Documents

The following documents are **required reading** before engaging with the OPM Architectural Foundations or any technical specification.

They are numbered to indicate the recommended reading order:

1. **What OPM Is (and Is Not)**  
   Establishes architectural boundaries and explicitly rejects EPUB-era assumptions.

2. **OPM in One Page**  
   Provides an ultra-concise summary of OPM’s architectural shape and core invariants.

3. **OPM in One Diagram**  
   Illustrates authority flow and the boundary between truth and behavior.

4. **Minimum Viable OPM Stack**  
   Defines the minimum architecture required to truthfully claim OPM support.

Readers who skip these documents will almost certainly misunderstand the specifications — not because the specifications are unclear, but because OPM intentionally rejects many inherited assumptions.

## Optional Context Document

The following document is **optional** and is **not** part of the required orientation sequence:

- **Why OPM Matters**

This document provides institutional, platform, and ecosystem context.  
It explains *why* the OPM architecture matters to real organisations, not *how* the architecture works.

It does not define or interpret the architecture and is not required to read the specifications.

## Scope Clarification

All documents in this directory:

- introduce no requirements
- define no processing rules
- carry no architectural authority

All normative authority resides exclusively in:

- the **OPM Architectural Foundations**, and
- the **OPM Technical Specifications**.

## Reading Guidance

Readers should complete the required orientation documents before reading:

- the Architectural Foundations (Parts A–H), or
- any technical specification within the OPM specification corpus.
