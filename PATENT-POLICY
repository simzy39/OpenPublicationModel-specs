Open Publication Model Patent Policy
Version 1.0

This Patent Policy applies to the Open Publication Model (OPM) specification corpus
published in this repository.

---

1. Purpose

The purpose of this Patent Policy is to encourage broad adoption, implementation,
and use of the Open Publication Model by reducing uncertainty around patent rights.

This policy is intended to be simple, permissive, and compatible with open
standards development.

---

2. Patent Commitment

Each contributor to this repository hereby agrees that, to the extent they own or
control any patent claims that are necessarily infringed by implementing the OPM
Specifications as written (a “Necessary Claim”), they grant a perpetual,
worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to make, use, sell,
offer for sale, import, and otherwise implement the Specifications.

This commitment applies only to implementations that conform to the Specifications.

---

3. Scope and Limitations

This Patent Policy:

- applies only to patent claims that are necessarily infringed by implementing the
  Specifications as written;
- does not apply to optional features or extensions not required by the Specifications;
- does not apply to implementations that are not conformant with the Specifications;
- does not grant rights to trademarks, logos, or branding.

No patent license is granted for any code, tools, or implementations unless
separately stated.

---

4. Defensive Termination

If any party initiates a patent claim asserting that the OPM Specifications or a
conformant implementation infringes a patent, any patent license granted to that
party under this policy shall terminate as of the date such claim is filed.

---

5. No Warranty

This Patent Policy is provided without warranty of any kind. No guarantee is made
that the Specifications are free from third-party patent claims.

---

6. Relationship to License

This Patent Policy is separate from and complementary to the Open Publication Model
Specification License. In the event of a conflict, this Patent Policy governs patent
rights only.
